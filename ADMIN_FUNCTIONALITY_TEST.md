# Admin Functionality Test Plan

## üéØ Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing plan for admin functionality after the RLS policy reset migration.

## üìã Pre-Test Setup

### 1. Apply the RLS Reset Migration
```bash
cd supabase
npx supabase db push
```

### 2. Verify Database State
Check that the migration was applied successfully:
```sql
-- Check that new policies exist
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND policyname LIKE 'rls_%'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Check that new functions exist
SELECT proname, prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname IN ('user_is_admin', 'get_user_primary_role');
```

## üîß Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Registration & Default Role Assignment

**Test Steps:**
1. Register a new user via `/auth/register`
2. Check that user gets default 'user' role

**Expected Results:**
- User can register successfully
- Default 'user' role is automatically assigned
- User can access their own data only

**SQL Verification:**
```sql
SELECT ur.user_id, ur.role, au.email
FROM user_roles ur
JOIN auth.users au ON ur.user_id = au.id
ORDER BY ur.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Scenario 2: Admin Role Assignment

**Test Steps:**
1. Create a test user (or use existing user)
2. Manually assign admin role:
```sql
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) 
VALUES ('USER_UUID_HERE', 'admin')
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```
3. Test admin access

**Expected Results:**
- User with admin role can access `/app/admin`
- Admin can see all users in admin panel
- Admin can modify user roles
- Admin can delete users

### Scenario 3: Regular User Restrictions

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as regular user (role: 'user')
2. Try to access `/app/admin`
3. Test data access via API

**Expected Results:**
- Regular user redirected away from admin routes
- Regular user can only see their own clients, appointments, invoices
- Regular user cannot access other users' data

### Scenario 4: Admin Data Access

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to admin panel
3. Test viewing all users' data

**Expected Results:**
- Admin can see user management interface
- Admin can view all users and their roles
- Admin can view system-wide statistics
- Admin actions are logged in admin_actions table

## üß™ Manual Test Checklist

### ‚úÖ Authentication Flow
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] Login works without setTimeout delay
- [ ] Navigation is immediate after login
- [ ] Default roles assigned correctly

### ‚úÖ Regular User Functionality
- [ ] User can create/view/edit/delete their own clients
- [ ] User can create/view/edit/delete their own appointments
- [ ] User can create/view/edit/delete their own invoices
- [ ] User can create/view/edit/delete their own services
- [ ] User cannot access admin routes
- [ ] User cannot see other users' data

### ‚úÖ Admin Functionality
- [ ] Admin can access `/app/admin` route
- [ ] Admin can view all users in system
- [ ] Admin can change user roles
- [ ] Admin can delete users
- [ ] Admin can view all users' data (read-only)
- [ ] Admin actions are logged
- [ ] Admin panel shows correct statistics

### ‚úÖ RLS Policy Verification
- [ ] No recursive policy errors in console
- [ ] Database queries execute without infinite loops
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (no slowdowns)
- [ ] Policies enforce proper data isolation

## üêõ Common Issues to Check

### Issue 1: Infinite Recursion
**Symptoms:** Browser hangs, database timeouts, high CPU usage
**Check:** Look for recursive function calls in policies
**Fix:** Ensure new `user_is_admin()` function doesn't reference itself

### Issue 2: Admin Access Denied
**Symptoms:** Admin users redirected from admin routes
**Check:** Verify role assignment and `checkRole()` function
**Fix:** Ensure roles are properly fetched and stored in auth store

### Issue 3: Data Leakage
**Symptoms:** Users seeing other users' data
**Check:** Test with multiple user accounts
**Fix:** Verify RLS policies are properly enforced

## üìä Performance Testing

### Database Query Performance
Test critical queries for performance:

```sql
-- Test role lookup performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT public.user_is_admin('USER_UUID_HERE');

-- Test user data access performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM clients WHERE user_id = 'USER_UUID_HERE';

-- Test admin data access performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT c.*, u.email as user_email
FROM clients c
JOIN auth.users u ON c.user_id = u.id
WHERE public.user_is_admin('ADMIN_USER_UUID');
```

### Frontend Performance
- [ ] Dashboard loads quickly after login
- [ ] Admin panel loads without delays
- [ ] Navigation is responsive
- [ ] No console errors related to auth/permissions

## üéâ Test Completion Criteria

The admin functionality testing is complete when:

1. ‚úÖ All manual test checklist items are verified
2. ‚úÖ No RLS policy recursion errors occur
3. ‚úÖ Performance is within acceptable limits
4. ‚úÖ Security boundaries are properly enforced
5. ‚úÖ Admin operations work as expected
6. ‚úÖ Regular user restrictions are enforced
